The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding.

      "Hello Warriors. Welcome to 'Universe of Loz: Battle of the Ages'. Here you will be introduced to a band of heroic warriors known as the Zerxocia. The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\n",

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding.

      "Hello Warriors. Welcome to 'Universe of Loz: Battle of the Ages'. Here you will be introduced to a band of heroic warriors known as the Zerxocia. The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\n",
      "The Great war for the universe of Loz has begun. Galiuto, the leader of the Zerxocia, expeditiously travels to the planet of Zon-noZ to battle Horschux. Horschux is a member of the Pileqs and a demon-warrior that has the power of fire. He has discovered a cache of Xono-rex and plans to procure it all and destroy the planet of Zon-noZ. Galiuto is an expert in all elemental powers.Galiuto's ship lands in Bun-nuB forest where Horschux awaits him with his arsenal. Galiuto exits his ship and confronts Horschux. In order to defeat Horschux, the master of fire, which element should Galiuto use to defeat Horschux? Air, Fire, Water, or Lightning? Water\n",
      "Horschux: Impossible, nooooo!!! <You have defeated Horschux>\n",
      "Horschux has been defeated by Galiuto. Galiuto meditates and watches over his companions with his stream of minds ability. Rev-Tyz is currently on Planet Oy-Boqa fighting Captain Phantox, who has found a mountain filled with Xono-rex. Phantox has the ability to warp whereas Rev-Tyz has super speed and lightning powers. How should Rev-Tyz defeat Phantox? Choose between lightning stun, lightning speed trail, or evasive counter maneuvers.lightning stun\n",
      "Captain Phantox: I cannot move, what is this? I can feel the lightning going through my cortices! *Fades away* <You have defeated Captain Phantox>\n",
      "Rev-Tyz believed that Captain Phantox was defeated and began to walk away slowly. Alas, there was a rumble in Rev-Tyz's senses. Captain Phantox reappeared stronger than ever. His warping abilities were immeasurable. 'Did you really believe that it would be that easy to defeat me? I am called 'Captain' for a reason. I will extract this mountain of its Xono-rex right after I defeat you!' exclamored Captain Phantox. Rev-Tyz stared at the all-powerful Captain Phantox in awe and assumed his fighting position. Captain Phantox initiated his warping strike, yet Rev-Tyz developed a maneuver fast. Which attack will you use? Lightning shield, Circumference of lightning, or Shock wimper?Circumference of lightning\n",
      "Captain Phantox: Such power! My warps are unable to surpass the speed of light. I will defeat you! <You have succeeded in blocking Captain Phantox's warping strike>\n",
      "'You must not know that I am Rev-Tyz, the second in command of the Zerxocia. It is quite unfortunate that your attacks are failing. I really expected for scum like you with the title 'Captain' to be a challenge... But you are just a waste of my time.' Rev-Tyz exclamors in a cocky manner. Lightning began to surround Rev-Tyz's body, creating a powerful aura. 'Let us fight til' the end then, second commander Rev-Tyz. The Pileqs will control life as you know it! *Chuckles*'Captain Phantox stated bravely. Rev-Tyz charges in with one of his most powerful attacks. Which will you use?

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding.

      "Hello Warriors. Welcome to 'Universe of Loz: Battle of the Ages'. Here you will be introduced to a band of heroic warriors known as the Zerxocia. The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\n",
      "The Great war for the universe of Loz has begun. Galiuto, the leader of the Zerxocia, expeditiously travels to the planet of Zon-noZ to battle Horschux. Horschux is a member of the Pileqs and a demon-warrior that has the power of fire. He has discovered a cache of Xono-rex and plans to procure it all and destroy the planet of Zon-noZ. Galiuto is an expert in all elemental powers.Galiuto's ship lands in Bun-nuB forest where Horschux awaits him with his arsenal. Galiuto exits his ship and confronts Horschux. In order to defeat Horschux, the master of fire, which element should Galiuto use to defeat Horschux? Air, Fire, Water, or Lightning? Water\n",
      "Horschux: Impossible, nooooo!!! <You have defeated Horschux>\n",
      "Horschux has been defeated by Galiuto. Galiuto meditates and watches over his companions with his stream of minds ability. Rev-Tyz is currently on Planet Oy-Boqa fighting Captain Phantox, who has found a mountain filled with Xono-rex. Phantox has the ability to warp whereas Rev-Tyz has super speed and lightning powers. How should Rev-Tyz defeat Phantox? Choose between lightning stun, lightning speed trail, or evasive counter maneuvers.lightning stun\n",
      "Captain Phantox: I cannot move, what is this? I can feel the lightning going through my cortices! *Fades away* <You have defeated Captain Phantox>\n",
      "Rev-Tyz believed that Captain Phantox was defeated and began to walk away slowly. Alas, there was a rumble in Rev-Tyz's senses. Captain Phantox reappeared stronger than ever. His warping abilities were immeasurable. 'Did you really believe that it would be that easy to defeat me? I am called 'Captain' for a reason. I will extract this mountain of its Xono-rex right after I defeat you!' exclamored Captain Phantox. Rev-Tyz stared at the all-powerful Captain Phantox in awe and assumed his fighting position. Captain Phantox initiated his warping strike, yet Rev-Tyz developed a maneuver fast. Which attack will you use? Lightning shield, Circumference of lightning, or Shock wimper?Circumference of lightning\n",
      "Captain Phantox: Such power! My warps are unable to surpass the speed of light. I will defeat you! <You have succeeded in blocking Captain Phantox's warping strike>\n",
      "'You must not know that I am Rev-Tyz, the second in command of the Zerxocia. It is quite unfortunate that your attacks are failing. I really expected for scum like you with the title 'Captain' to be a challenge... But you are just a waste of my time.' Rev-Tyz exclamors in a cocky manner. Lightning began to surround Rev-Tyz's body, creating a powerful aura. 'Let us fight til' the end then, second commander Rev-Tyz. The Pileqs will control life as you know it! *Chuckles*'Captain Phantox stated bravely. Rev-Tyz charges in with one of his most powerful attacks. Which will you use?

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding.

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon.

The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon.

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding.

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",

      "Hello Warriors. Welcome to 'Universe of Loz: Battle of the Ages'. Here you will be introduced to a band of heroic warriors known as the Zerxocia. The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\n",
      "The Great war for the universe of Loz has begun. Galiuto, the leader of the Zerxocia, expeditiously travels to the planet of Zon-noZ to battle Horschux. Horschux is a member of the Pileqs and a demon-warrior that has the power of fire. He has discovered a cache of Xono-rex and plans to procure it all and destroy the planet of Zon-noZ. Galiuto is an expert in all elemental powers.Galiuto's ship lands in Bun-nuB forest where Horschux awaits him with his arsenal. Galiuto exits his ship and confronts Horschux. In order to defeat Horschux, the master of fire, which element should Galiuto use to defeat Horschux? Air, Fire, Water, or Lightning? Water\n",

His warping abilities were immeasurable. 'Did you really believe that it would be that easy to defeat me? I am called 'Captain' for a reason. I will extract this mountain of its Xono-rex right after I defeat you!' exclamored Captain Phantox. Rev-Tyz stared at the all-powerful Captain Phantox in awe and assumed his fighting position. Captain Phantox initiated his warping strike, yet Rev-Tyz developed a maneuver fast. Which attack will you use? Lightning shield, Circumference of lightning, or Shock wimper?Lightning shield\n",

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",

      "Hello Warriors. Welcome to 'Universe of Loz: Battle of the Ages'. Here you will be introduced to a band of heroic warriors known as the Zerxocia. The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\n",

Horschux is a member of the Pileqs and a demon-warrior that has the power of fire. He has discovered a cache of Xono-rex and plans to procure it all and destroy the planet of Zon-noZ. Galiuto is an expert in all elemental powers.Galiuto's ship lands in Bun-nuB forest where Horschux awaits him with his arsenal. Galiuto exits his ship and confronts Horschux.

His warping abilities were immeasurable. 'Did you really believe that it would be that easy to defeat me? I am called 'Captain' for a reason. I will extract this mountain of its Xono-rex right after I defeat you!' exclamored Captain Phantox. Rev-Tyz stared at the all-powerful Captain Phantox in awe and assumed his fighting position.

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",

      "Hello Warriors. Welcome to 'Universe of Loz: Battle of the Ages'. Here you will be introduced to a band of heroic warriors known as the Zerxocia. The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\n",

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",

      "Hello Warriors. Welcome to 'Universe of Loz: Battle of the Ages'. Here you will be introduced to a band of heroic warriors known as the Zerxocia. The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\n",

Galiuto is an expert in all elemental powers.Galiuto's ship lands in Bun-nuB forest where Horschux awaits him with his arsenal. Galiuto exits his ship and confronts Horschux.

I will extract this mountain of its Xono-rex right after I defeat you!' exclamored Captain Phantox. Rev-Tyz stared at the all-powerful Captain Phantox in awe and assumed his fighting position.

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",

      "Hello Warriors. Welcome to 'Universe of Loz: Battle of the Ages'. Here you will be introduced to a band of heroic warriors known as the Zerxocia. The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\n",

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding.

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\n",

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding.

      "Hello Warriors. Welcome to 'Universe of Loz: Battle of the Ages'. Here you will be introduced to a band of heroic warriors known as the Zerxocia. The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\n",

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding.

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding.

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding.

      "Hello Warriors. Welcome to 'Universe of Loz: Battle of the Ages'. Here you will be introduced to a band of heroic warriors known as the Zerxocia. The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\n",

      "The Great war for the universe of Loz has begun. Galiuto, the leader of the Zerxocia, expeditiously travels to the planet of Zon-noZ to battle Horschux. Horschux is a member of the Pileqs and a demon-warrior that has the power of fire. He has discovered a cache of Xono-rex and plans to procure it all and destroy the planet of Zon-noZ. Galiuto is an expert in all elemental powers.Galiuto's ship lands in Bun-nuB forest where Horschux awaits him with his arsenal. Galiuto exits his ship and confronts Horschux. In order to defeat Horschux, the master of fire, which element should Galiuto use to defeat Horschux? Air, Fire, Water, or Lightning? Water\n",

Rev-Tyz is currently on Planet Oy-Boqa fighting Captain Phantox, who has found a mountain filled with Xono-rex. Phantox has the ability to warp whereas Rev-Tyz has super speed and lightning powers. How should Rev-Tyz defeat Phantox? Choose between lightning stun, lightning speed trail, or evasive counter maneuvers.evasive counter maneuvers\n",

      "\u001b[0m\n",
      "Rev-Tyz believed that Captain Phantox was defeated and began to walk away slowly. Alas, there was a rumble in Rev-Tyz's senses. Captain Phantox reappeared stronger than ever. His warping abilities were immeasurable. 'Did you really believe that it would be that easy to defeat me? I am called 'Captain' for a reason. I will extract this mountain of its Xono-rex right after I defeat you!' exclamored Captain Phantox. Rev-Tyz stared at the all-powerful Captain Phantox in awe and assumed his fighting position. Captain Phantox initiated his warping strike, yet Rev-Tyz developed a maneuver fast. Which attack will you use? Lightning shield, Circumference of lightning, or Shock wimper?Lightning shield\n",
      "\u001b[32mCaptain Phantox: Gah! Your shield is immensely powerful, I will need to instantaneously develop a new maneuver <You have succeeded in blocking Captain Phantox's warping strike>\n",

      "'You must not know that I am Rev-Tyz, the second in command of the Zerxocia. It is quite unfortunate that your attacks are failing. I really expected for scum like you with the title 'Captain' to be a challenge... But you are just a waste of my time.' Rev-Tyz exclamors in a cocky manner. Lightning began to surround Rev-Tyz's body, creating a powerful aura. 'Let us fight til' the end then, second commander Rev-Tyz. The Pileqs will control life as you know it! *Chuckles*'Captain Phantox stated bravely. Rev-Tyz charges in with one of his most powerful attacks. Which will you use? Lightning fury, Speed of light slash, or Angelic blasphemy?Angelic blasphemy\n",
      "\u001b[32m'Witness a blinding light of defeat' Rev-Tyz stated as he blinded the entire area with lightning strikes. <Captain Phantox was hit with a powerful blast and is wounded>\n",

Captain Phantox stated while holding his fatal wound.'As an honorable warrior, I will give you this data sheet that contains the information of the Pileqs. This is my first and last act of kindness and my redemption. Farewell.' Captain Phantox perished to dust and Rev-Tyz obtained the data sheet. What will you do now? Condolences, Meditate, or Focus?Focus\n",
      "\u001b[32m'Alas, I have obtained the data sheet of the Pileqs. Now I can determine which planets they plan to conquer next. But first I must decipher it. Hmm...' Rev-Tyz stated intelligently. <You can now examine the data sheet>\n",

Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding.

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",

    "Introduction = \"Hello Warriors. Welcome to 'Universe of Loz: Battle of the Ages'. Here you will be introduced to a band of heroic warriors known as the Zerxocia. The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",

    "Introduction = \"Hello Warriors. Welcome to 'Universe of Loz: Battle of the Ages'. Here you will be introduced to a band of heroic warriors known as the Zerxocia. The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",

      "Hello Warriors. Welcome to 'Universe of Loz: Battle of the Ages'. Here you will be introduced to a band of heroic warriors known as the Zerxocia. The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\n",

Horschux is a member of the Pileqs and a demon-warrior that has the power of fire. He has discovered a cache of Xono-rex and plans to procure it all and destroy the planet of Zon-noZ. Galiuto is an expert in all elemental powers.Galiuto's ship lands in Bun-nuB forest where Horschux awaits him with his arsenal. Galiuto exits his ship and confronts Horschux. In order to defeat Horschux, the master of fire, which element should Galiuto use to defeat Horschux? Air, Fire, Water, or Lightning? Water\n",

Rev-Tyz is currently on Planet Oy-Boqa fighting Captain Phantox, who has found a mountain filled with Xono-rex. Phantox has the ability to warp whereas Rev-Tyz has super speed and lightning powers. How should Rev-Tyz defeat Phantox? Choose between lightning stun, lightning speed trail, or evasive counter maneuvers.lightning stun\n",

      "Rev-Tyz believed that Captain Phantox was defeated and began to walk away slowly. Alas, there was a rumble in Rev-Tyz's senses. Captain Phantox reappeared stronger than ever. His warping abilities were immeasurable. 'Did you really believe that it would be that easy to defeat me? I am called 'Captain' for a reason. I will extract this mountain of its Xono-rex right after I defeat you!' exclamored Captain Phantox. Rev-Tyz stared at the all-powerful Captain Phantox in awe and assumed his fighting position. Captain Phantox initiated his warping strike, yet Rev-Tyz developed a maneuver fast. Which attack will you use? Lightning shield, Circumference of lightning, or Shock wimper?Lightning shield\n",

I really expected for scum like you with the title 'Captain' to be a challenge... But you are just a waste of my time.' Rev-Tyz exclamors in a cocky manner. Lightning began to surround Rev-Tyz's body, creating a powerful aura. 'Let us fight til' the end then, second commander Rev-Tyz. The Pileqs will control life as you know it! *Chuckles*'Captain Phantox stated bravely. Rev-Tyz charges in with one of his most powerful attacks. Which will you use? Lightning fury, Speed of light slash, or Angelic blasphemy?Lightning fury\n",

    "Introduction = \"Hello Warriors. Welcome to 'Universe of Loz: Battle of the Ages'. Here you will be introduced to a band of heroic warriors known as the Zerxocia. The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",

    "Introduction = \"Hello Warriors. Welcome to 'Universe of Loz: Battle of the Ages'. Here you will be introduced to a band of heroic warriors known as the Zerxocia. The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",

The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding.

The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon.

Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding.

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding.

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding.

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",

The Zerxocia's arch nemesis, the Pileqs, have decided to begin their conquest of the Universe of Loz. Thus far, the Pileqs have raided several planets for their gold-like substance called 'Xono-rex'. Proceeding each raid, the Pileqs would destroy each planet and insert the Xono-rex into their super-ship, called the Lone-King, to power it. The Lone-King is said to be able to destroy two universes with one blast of its' omega-cannon. It is up to the Zerxocia to stop the Pileqs from obtaining Xono-rex and destroying planets in order to save both their own universe and those surrounding. My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this adventure, the overseer of the Universe of Loz. Enjoy.\"\n",
