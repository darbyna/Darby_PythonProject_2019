# Darby_PythonProject_2019
Project for Introduction to Python Fall 2019 

Greetings all,

My name is Niko Darby and I am the creator of this code. In this project I will be constructing a game titled, "Universe of Loz: Battle of the Ages." In the code itself, I attempt to solve the real-world problem of developing a survey that individuals can answer and constructing a data chart that can be scrutinized immensely. The data chart is not "real" data. Instead, it is prototype data constructed in a Microsoft Excel file and converted into a ".csv" file. 

The code itself will present a plethora of the Python-based abilities that I have mastered this semester. For instance, some of the skills that will be encountered in this code includes building functions, making lists and tuples, understanding SyntaxErrors and how to overcome them [in the test folder], downloading and using packages such as pandas, numpy, or matplotlib.pyplot, and much more. 

  As mentioned previously, this is a code that has been designed to be a game. There will be an abundance of scenarios where you will have the ability to choose the action of a preset character. Your actions will determine how the story will proceed. While examining the folder named "Notebook_Jupyter" you will see the tests performed to improve this project. The folder named "Darby_PythonProject_2019" has the complete code available for your examination.

Enjoy!
