## NOTICE ON TESTS 



### [Update 1]:

pytest will be utilized to examine this code for errors. Since I have a "magic" in this code, pytest will classify it as an error. For those of you that are unaware of "magic", it is a function that begins with %. In my case, I have %matplotlib.pyplot.

### [Update 2]: 

The magics were removed from the code and the test is now completely clean.
