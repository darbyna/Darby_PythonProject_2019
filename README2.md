Greetings, 

My name is Niko Darby and this is my final project for Introduction to Python. In this project I will be constructing a game utilizing the skills that we have learned this semester. Some of the skills range from building functions, making lists and tuples, understanding SyntaxErrors and how to overcome them, downloading and using packages such as pandas, numpy, or matplotlib, and much more. Unfortunately, I do not have any statistical data for this project, thus, there may not be any graphs or charts. Instead this project will focus on operating python in a survey-type manner.

The game is called "Universe of Loz: Battle of the Ages". In this game you will be introduced to characters and select their actions to proceed through the story. The story is very short due to the lack of time, however, throughout the years this will be built upon. While examining the folder named "Notebook_Jupyter" you will see the tests performed to improve this project. The folder named "Darby_PythonProject_2019" has the complete code available for your examination.
